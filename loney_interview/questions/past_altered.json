	"But I remember I had some timelines where I countered all of Désirée's, Calixta's and Dolores' bullying, murdered them in cold blood, some modifications on my parents, attempting to make Super Mario 64-style graphics and a bunch of experiments with the two guys that nearly raped me.",
	"[H]And that isn't an exhaustive list?",
	"[L]Not by a long shot.",
	"[H]Alright then . . ."
