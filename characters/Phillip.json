This is someone else's character !\nThey asked me to make a kit for them.\n\nShort Lore:\n\tSon of a president whose family somehow is always years ahead in technology than the rest of the world.\n\tFrom little they tried brainwashing him to be the next president, but with little effect due to his infatuantion with videogames.\n\tOne day, they were attacked by robots.\n\tPhillip fought bravely until his laft fue, for he ran out of ammo.\n\tPhillip's body was shot multiple times by the misterious robot.\n\tWhen Phillip regains conciousnous, robotic arms perform operations on him as his parents instructed the doctor to conduct a surgery where his damaged body parts would be replaced with android parts to stabilize his condition.\n\nPersonality: \n\t- Calm and patient with a side of sadism\n\t- He avoids unnecessary killing due to his family's reputation, but he clearly enjoys it.\n\t- At first he tries to hide it, but when he's REALLY in the heat of battle, he will definitely show he enjoys it (IDEA: Change his animations based on his killstreak/multi kill.)\n\t- Basically the \"Damn you! You are making this fun!\" anime cliche.",
