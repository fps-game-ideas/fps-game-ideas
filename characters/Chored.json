Corp as a Test Model, Chored is the first Entertainment Robot with a company standard Artificial Intelligence.\nChored was sold to the Sunshine Hideout at a huge discount, as I. A. Corp needed to stress-test it.\nAs Chored started to perform, more and more people started to come to Sunshine Hideout, and Chored gained a lot of experience quickly.\nHowever, as she performed, she became curious about human behaviour and wanted to know everything about it so she could finally understand and experience the emotions she has to fake on stage on a daily basis.\n\t\nWhen the civil war came, Sunshine Hideout had their schedule shrinked, as more and more problems would cause lack of shows.\nChored received the duty of keeping the building safe and was given some basic combat- and medical upgrades, just like the other staff members.",
